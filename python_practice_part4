#Write a Python function called max_num()to find the maximum of three numbers.
def max_num(a,b,c):
    return max(a,b,c)

print(max_num(1,2,3))
print(max_num(100,50,1))

#Write a Python function called mult_list() to multiply all the numbers in a list.
def mult_list(numbers):
    result = 1
    for num in numbers:
        result *= num
    return result

# Example usage
number_list = [2, 3, 5, 7]
product = mult_list(number_list)
print(product)  # This will output 210 (2 * 3 * 5 * 7)

#Write a Python function called rev_string() to reverse a string.
def rev_string(input_string):
    return input_string[::-1]

# Example usage
original_string = "Hello, World!"
reversed_string = rev_string(original_string)
print(reversed_string)  # This will output "!dlroW ,olleH"

#Write a Python function called num_within() to check whether a number falls in a given range.
#The function accepts the number, beginning of range, and end of range (inclusive) as arguments.
#Examples: num_within(3,2,4) returns True, num_within(3,1,3) returns True, num_within(10,2,5) returns False.
def num_within(x,a,b):
  return x in range(a,b+1)
     
print(num_within(3,2,4))     
print(num_within(3,1,3))     
print(num_within(10,2,5))

#Write a Python function called pascal() that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
#The function accepts the number n, the number of rows to print
#Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal. Each number is the two numbers above it added together.
